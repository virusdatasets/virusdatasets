1- We suggest you remove the partial sequences for better phylogenetic tree
2- We suggest generating a tree based on protein sequences
3- In the future submission, we will try to prepare a larger file more than 74 sequences to include all the important sequences, however, we believe the 50-sequence fasta file already includes all the necessary sequences for a good tree
