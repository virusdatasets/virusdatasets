1- We suggest you remove the partial sequences for better phylogenetic tree
2- We suggest generating a tree based on protein sequences because sometimes the algorithms for nucleotides do not make desired tree
3- Distances were computed using nucleotides as mentioned in the caption of the Excel file
4- In the future submissions, we will try to prepare a larger file (more than 74 sequences) to include all the important sequences, however, we believe the 50-sequence fasta file already includes all the necessary sequences for a good tree
